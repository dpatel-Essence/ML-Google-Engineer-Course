    "\n",
    "ML systems learn how to combine input to produce useful predictions on never-before-seen data.\n",
    "Let's explore fundamental machine learning terminology.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Labels**  \n",
    "A label is the thing we're predicting—the y variable in simple linear regression. The label could be the future price of wheat, the kind of animal shown in a picture, the meaning of an audio clip, or just about anything.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Features**  \n",
    "A feature is an input variable—the x variable in simple linear regression. A simple machine learning project might use a single feature, while a more sophisticated machine learning project could use millions of features  \n",
    "\n",
    "**Training**  \n",
    "Training means creating or learning the model. That is, you show the model labeled examples and enable the model to gradually learn the relationships between features and label.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Inference**  \n",
    "Inference means applying the trained model to unlabeled examples. That is, you use the trained model to make useful predictions (y'). For example, during inference, you can predict medianHouseValue for new unlabeled examples."
